## Problem Statement
Predicting stock prices is a complex task with various factors affecting price movements. This project aims to build a predictive model that can forecast stock prices based on historical data, helping investors make informed decisions.

## Data Collection
- Historical stock market data is collected from reliable sources such as [source1] and [source2].
- Features include date, open price, close price, volume, and additional relevant indicators.
- Data consistency and accuracy are ensured.

## Data Preprocessing
- Missing data is handled using interpolation/imputation techniques.
- Numerical features are normalized or scaled.
- Categorical features are converted into numerical representations.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to understand data distributions and identify outliers.

## Feature Engineering
- Additional features are created, including moving averages (e.g., 20-day, 50-day, 200-day), technical indicators (e.g., Bollinger Bands, RSI), and lagged variables.
- External factors like economic indicators or news sentiment analysis are considered if relevant.

## Model Selection
- Time series forecasting models like ARIMA, LSTM, and GRU are considered.
- Ensemble methods and hybrid models are explored for improved accuracy.

## Model Training
- Data is split into training, validation, and test sets.
- The selected model is trained using the training data.
- Hyperparameters are tuned using the validation set to optimize performance.
- Techniques to prevent overfitting are implemented.

## Evaluation
- The model's performance is evaluated using time series forecasting metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and directional accuracy.
- Backtesting is performed to assess historical performance.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script for stock price prediction.
4. View the model's predictions and evaluation results.
